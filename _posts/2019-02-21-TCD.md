**The Unknown Third Giant**

The book starts on a chat between two protagonists : a philosopher and a youth. 
The Unknown Third Giant is about Adler who was one of the greatest philosopher of his time. Most of the time when we think about philosophy it is about Freud and Jung. Adler and Freud were very closed in age; it is a common mistake to think that Adler was Freud's student. Although the youth was not really convinced, the philospher confirmed again that he is a person who lives in philosophy as Adler's psychology.

**Why People Can Change**

In this chapter, the youth asked him questions about humain change and gave him an example about one of his friend who is kind of stuck in his room. He can not go outside because he is too scared to. For the philosopher this example is a common one : he has shutted down himself by choice; because he did not want to go outside, he created his state of anxiety. Moreover, the past does not matter : causes are not what we are now; it has been defined by our goals. We decided to be like this.   
At the end, the philosopher introduced two ideas :   
- etiology (the study of causation)
- teleology (the study of purpose of a given phenomenon)
