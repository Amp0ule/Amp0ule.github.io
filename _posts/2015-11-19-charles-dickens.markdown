I started Project Sparta to teach myself how to find information online effectively. The aim is to do proper research, collect information and evaluate it to properly answer a very specific question. The project will teach me how to identify resources online that are hard to find and also teach me how to evaluate what I find. I started with the intention of honing my research skills and to train myself to be unguillable and unbiased.

This is next to impossible on the present day web. Webpages as a rule do not cite their sources and those sources are questionable and unreliable. The information is often second or even third hand. There is literally nothing stopping you from writing what you want, anyway you want and to top it all falsifying information. Project Sparta is a lesson in self improvement. It is a quest to escape from the darker side of the internet. Good content is there but finding it is the hardest part.

##Hunting in the Deep Web

Ever since its inception the world wide web has kept on growing and growing adding billions of webpages and centuries of video content. This very complexity of the web ensures the obscurity of good content. Popular estimates places the number of webpages that are indexed and searchable by popular search engines at a very meagre percentage of the entire web. The rest of the non indexed, impossible to find information on the web is called the deep web. Access to the deep web is restricted because:

1.  They are marked by the sites `robot.txt` as non indexible. 
1. They require special permission i.e. company databases.
1. They are stored in databases that generate webpages for individual queries i.e. Library Catalogs
1. Have paywalls put in place.
1. Aren't linked to from any other webpage.

One day perhaps all the webpages on the internet might be indexed by a search engine. Until then a lot of content on the Web shall remain in the deep web.

Another important objective of Project Sparta would be to teach me to effectively hunt for information in the deep web.
