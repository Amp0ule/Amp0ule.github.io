Feeling Good by David Burns, 1980.

***
**Chapter 1 - A breakthrough in the Treatment of Mood Disorders**

Depression is the number one public health problem in the world. 

Cognitive Therapy (CT) is a mood modification that you can learn on your own :
    1. Rapid Symptomatic Improvement 
    2. Understanding : clear explanation of your actual mood.
    3. Self-control 
    4. Prevention and Personnal Growth : reassessment.

You create those feelings by the dialogue you are having with yourself.

Cognitive distortions :

1. ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING : Black and White
    
2. OVERGENERALIZATION : single negative event = never-ending pattern of defeat
    
3. MENTAL FILTER : one negative event is making everything dark (drop on ink)

4. DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE : they-dont-count experiences

5. JUMPING TO CONCLUSION : negative interpretation over sth (Mind reading  & Fortune Teller Error)

6. MAGNIFICATION OR MINI : exageration of failures vs minimisation of strenghts

7. EMOTIONAL REASONING : your emotions = reality (procra)

8. SHOULDY : guilt

9. LABELING & MISLABELING : cf OVER - labeling yourself the wrong way

10. PERSONALIZATION : responsabilities to others (teachers)

**Chapter 4 - Start by building self-esteem**

depressed self-image : 4DS -> Defeated, Defective, Deserted, Deprived

you cannot earn worth through what you do : achievement can bring you satisfaction but not happiness

1. train yourself to recognize and write down
2. learn why these thoughts are distorted
3. practice talking back

triple column technique : automatic thought \| cognitive distorsion \| rational response \| emotions

mental biofeedback : wrist counter monitoring your negative thoughts

your life is an evolving experience, a continual flow
