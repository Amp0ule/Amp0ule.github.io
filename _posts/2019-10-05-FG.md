Feeling Good by David Burns, 1980.

***
**Chapter 1 - A breakthrough in the Treatment of Mood Disorders**

Depression is the number one public health problem in the world. 

Cognitive Therapy (CT) is a mood modification that you can learn on your own :
    1. Rapid Symptomatic Improvement 
    2. Understanding : clear explanation of your actual mood.
    3. Self-control 
    4. Prevention and Personnal Growth : reassessment.

You create those feelings by the dialogue you are having with yourself.

Cognitive distortions :
    1. ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING : Black and White
    2. OVERGENERALIZATION : single negative event = never-ending pattern of defeat
    3. MENTAL FILTER : one negative event is making everything dark (drop on ink)
    4. DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE : they-dont-count experiences
    5. JUMPING TO CONCLUSION : negative interpretation over sth (Mind reading  & Fortune Teller Error)
    6. MAGNIFICATION OR MINI : exageration of failures vs minimisation of strenghts
    7. EMOTIONAL REASONING : your emotions = reality (procra)
    8. SHOULDY : guilt
    9. LABELING & MISLABELING : cf OVER - labeling yourself the wrong way
    10. PERSONALIZATION : responsabilities to others (teachers)
