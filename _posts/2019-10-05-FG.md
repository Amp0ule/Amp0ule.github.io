Feeling Good by David Burns, 1980.

***
**Chapter 1 - A breakthrough in the Treatment of Mood Disorders**

Depression is the number one public health problem in the world. 

Cognitive Therapy (CT) is a mood modification that you can learn on your own :
    1. Rapid Symptomatic Improvement 
    2. Understanding : clear explanation of your actual mood.
    3. Self-control 
    4. Prevention and Personnal Growth : reassessment.

You create those feelings by the dialogue you are having with yourself.

Cognitive distortions :

1. ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING : Black and White
    
2. OVERGENERALIZATION : single negative event = never-ending pattern of defeat
    
3. MENTAL FILTER : one negative event is making everything dark (drop on ink)

4. DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE : they-dont-count experiences

5. JUMPING TO CONCLUSION : negative interpretation over sth (Mind reading  & Fortune Teller Error)

6. MAGNIFICATION OR MINI : exageration of failures vs minimisation of strenghts

7. EMOTIONAL REASONING : your emotions = reality (procra)

8. SHOULDY : guilt

9. LABELING & MISLABELING : cf OVER - labeling yourself the wrong way

10. PERSONALIZATION : responsabilities to others (teachers)

**Chapter 4 - Start by building self-esteem**

depressed self-image : 4DS -> Defeated, Defective, Deserted, Deprived

you cannot earn worth through what you do : achievement can bring you satisfaction but not happiness

1. train yourself to recognize and write down
2. learn why these thoughts are distorted
3. practice talking back

triple column technique : automatic thought \| cognitive distorsion \| rational response \| emotions

mental biofeedback : wrist counter monitoring your negative thoughts

your life is an evolving experience, a continual flow

**Chapter 5 - Do-Nothingism: How to beat if**
 
 you can change your mood by changing how you think
 you can change the way your feel by the way you act

 mindset associated with procrastination:

 - hopelessness : irreversible
 - helplessness: beyond control
 - overwhelming yourself : impossible to tackle
 - jumping to conclusion : not within your power
 - self-labeling : a procrastinator
 - undervaluing the rewards : anhedonia or  diminished ability to experience satisfaction and pleasure
 - perfectionism : inappropriate goals
 - fear of failure : overgeneralization
 - fear of success : anticipate that people will demand more on you
 - fear of disapprouval or criticism : risk of rejection
 - coercion or resentment: should
 - low frustration tolerance : state of panic and rage -> entitlement syndrome
 - guilt and self-blame : predict the future or how to intervene


 METHODO:

 1. The daily activity schedule : 2 columns \| PROSPECTIVE \| RESTROSPECTIVE
 2. The antiprocrastination sheet : ACTIVITY \| PREDICTED DIFFICULTY\| PREDICTED SATISFACTION \| ACTUAL DIFFICULTY \| ACTUAL SATISFACTION
 3. Daily record of dysfunctional thoughts : SITUATION \| EMOTIONS \| AUTOMATIC T \| RATIONAL RES \| OUTCOME
 4. The pleasure predicting sheet : ACTIVITY \| WITH? \| PREDICTED SATISFACTION \| ACTUAL 
 5. The but rebuttal : combatting your "buts" with realistic rebuttals
 6. Self-endorsement : Make a list of things you do accomplish each day (vs self-downing thoughts)
 7. TIC-TOC technique : Task-oriented cognitions vs task-interference cognitions 
 8. Little steps aka baby steps : break the task down into littles pieces
 9. Motivation without coercion : eliminate the "shoulds" + make a list of avantages/disavantages
10. Disarming technique : capable of doing your own thinking 
11. Visualize success : list of the positive benefits of having changed the habit
12. Count what counts : wrist counter of positive habits
13. Test your can'ts : challenge your negative predictions
14. Can't lose system : negative consequence of failure -> coping strategy 

Action -> Motivation -> More Action
Other people's thoughts do not affect your mood

***
**Chapter 6 - Learn to talk back when you are under the fire of criticism**

cause of your worthlessness = self-criticism

- learn to identify the negatives thoughts when you are being criticized

1. empathy : ask bunch of questions about the meaning of the attack
2. disarm the critic :  skillfully disarm your opponent -> find some way to agree with him/her -> avoid sarcasm and defensiveness -> speak the truth
3. feedback and negotation : avoid destructing labels -> his error does not make him stupid or worthless
winner = present your point of view with diplomacy
4. antiheckler technique :  thanks -> acknowledge the points -> emphasize that there is need for more knowledge -> invite to share his/her views

do not chose the mad route
