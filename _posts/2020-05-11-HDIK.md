But How Do It Know? J.Clark Scott. 2009

secret of computers -> not complex but speed

inside all computers : bits

computer -> 3 connections: 2 inputs - 1 output

gate : 2 bits

AND & NAND(circle) gate : "D" shape

chip: puce

diagramm

code: something that tells you what something else means

bits -> place where there is or not some electricity : on/off

b**y**te ->8 bites

American standard code information interchange : ASCII

Enabler: eight AND gates together

Byte (B) + Enabler (E) = Register (R) -> record some place of information (aka state of eight inputs bits)

bus = set of eight wires connected that goes to various places in a comp (buss -> bar of metal used in power generation plants)

byte ->locationc 

decoder : 2 inputs  / 4 outpus -> NOT gates and AND gates

RAM - Random Access Memory -> 257 registers : 256 memory storage location + 1 to select -> memory address register (MAR)

Tally Marks -> system to count 5 by 5 

decimal system : 0 - 10 (dec = 10)
senary system : 0 - 5 (sen = six)
binary system : (bi = 2)
hexadecimal system (hex = 6 + dec = 10)

computer address = number that causes a certain byte to be selected when that address is placed into the MAR

other half = CPU -> Central processing unit

TMP -> temporary register (set bite but not enable bite)
ACC -> accumulator = temporarly store a byte that comes from the big box

registers in CPU + RAM = content of bytes come from and go as computer operates

OR gate
XOR gate

RAM -> store and retrieve one bit at a time -> the bus moves a bit at a time
