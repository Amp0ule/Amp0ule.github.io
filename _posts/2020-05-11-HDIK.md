But How Do It Know? J.Clark Scott. 2009

secret of computers -> not complex but speed

inside all computers : bits

computer -> 3 connections: 2 inputs - 1 output

gate : 2 bits

AND & NAND(circle) gate : "D" shape

chip: puce

diagramm

code: something that tells you what something else means

bits -> place where there is or not some electricity : on/off

b**y**te ->8 bites

American standard code information interchange : ASCII

Enabler: eight AND gates together

Byte (B) + Enabler (E) = Register (R) -> record some place of information (aka state of eight inputs bits)

bus = set of eight wires connected that goes to various places in a comp (buss -> bar of metal used in power generation plants)

byte ->location
