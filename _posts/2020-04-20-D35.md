**WHATS UP**

- after 4 weeks of trying to build constant habits, I decided to start a new daily plan. 

<p>

 MORNING : Sport / Mediation / Language / Appearance  <br />
 AFTERNOON : Education  <br />
 EVENING : Reading / Piano <br /> 
 LATE : Random  <br /> <br />

</p>

- The plan is to build more persistence into building my habits. If I keep focusing on one subject at a specific time, I will be more incline to do it again the next following day.
