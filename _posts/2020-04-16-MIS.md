**Misunderstood**

- better to draw the new knowledge into old one and build mindmap according to it

- rereading is not the key, repeating is

***

**Mix up practice**

- massed practice : repetitive practice on one thing at a time
- spaced practice : review material over a long period of time
- interleaved practice : mixing multiple subjects at a time
- varied practice :  frequent changes of task = confront new situations e.g beanbag
- discrimation skills :  understanding of the interrelationships of the basic elements within a larger structure 


***

**Embrace difficulties**

e.g. Mia Blundetto - U.S Marine Corps and the jumping school

Learning:

- encoding : converting sensory perceptions into meaningful representations
- consolidatiom : strenghtening these mental representations for long-term memory
- retrieval : associate the material with a diverse set of cues to recall them (updating retrival cues - easier is not better)

How effort helps:

- reconsolidating memory : the more effort that is required to recall a memory the more the act of recalling benefits the learning
- creating mental models : complex set of interrelated ideas 
- broadening mastery : retrieving practice that you perfom at different times - contexts = building interconnected networks
- fostering conceptual learning : spaced  and interleaved exposure (new concepts e.g. animals)
- improving versatility : practice like you play - play like you practice


Priming the mind for learning:


Generative learning: trying to answer before having it   
Reflection learning: taking a minute to review what has been learned from an experience


Undesirable difficulties vs desirable difficulties

Make mistakes, make mistakes!

**Avoid illusion of knowing**

monitoring your own thinking

system 1 (automatic system) : unconscious, intuitive and immediate

system 2 (the controlled system) : slower process of conscious analysis and reasoning

illusion of comprehension \| competence \| remembering

<br/>
memory can be distorted in many ways

- imagination inflation : imagine an event -> begin to believe it
- suggestion : way of a question is asked (e.g witnesses)
- interferences : from other events
- curse of knowledge : tendency to underestimate the time to teach someone (hindsight bias \| knew-it-all-long effect)
- feeling of knowing
- fluency illusion: mistake fluency with a text
- social influence : the social contagion of memory
- *false consensus effect*: fail to recognize the idiosyncratic nature of our personal understanding of the world (e.g gun control)
- flashbulb memories: vivid images of what we retain (e.g 9/11 what you were doing)


mental models:

- the better you know something, the more difficult it becomes to teach it (Harvard)

unskilled and unaware of it:

- incompetent people lack the skills to improve because they are unable to distinguish between incompetence and competence
- Drunning-Kruger effect : incompetent people tend to overestimate their own competence and fail to mismatch what they need to improve (probs caused by negative feedback from others or innacurate =/= success : must go right)
- replace subjective experience with a set of objective gauges outside ourselves to square the judgement with the real world

tools and habits for calibrating your judgment:

- frequent use of testing and retrieval practice
- *do not drop material* from your testing regime once you have gotten it correct 
- *practice and practice again*
- *Peer Instruction* : learning model = reading beforehand + feedback
- *mistakes* are the most efficient way for calibrating your sense of what you know and don't.

**Get beyond learning styles**

- all learners are different

active learning from the get-go:

- VARK : differentiate people according their learning experience (visual, auditory, etc.)

successful intelligence:

- *Fluid* intelligence : ability to reason, see relationships, think abstractly
- *crystallized* intelligence: accumulate knowledge and mental models
 
 Sternberg:

 - *Analytical* int
 - *Creative* int
 - *Practical* int 

**Dynamic testing**

1 - a test of some kind to show me where I come up short in knowledge <br/>
2 - dedicate myself to become more competent : reflection/practice/spacing/others

<br/>
3 - test myself again paying attention to what works better and where I need more work<br/>
