****Misunderstood***

- better to draw the new knowledge into old one and build mindmap according to it

- rereading is not the key, repeating is

Mix up practice:

- massed practice : repetitive practice on one thing at a time
- spaced practice : review material over a long period of time
- interleaved practice : mixing multiple subjects at a time
- varied practice :  frequent changes of task = confront new situations e.g beanbag
- discrimation skills :  understanding of the interrelationships of the basic elements within a larger structure
