**2. Misunderstood**

- better to draw the new knowledge into old one and build mindmap according to it

- rereading is not the key, repeating is

***

**3. Mix up practice**

- massed practice : repetitive practice on one thing at a time
- spaced practice : review material over a long period of time
- interleaved practice : mixing multiple subjects at a time
- varied practice :  frequent changes of task = confront new situations e.g beanbag
- discrimation skills :  understanding of the interrelationships of the basic elements within a larger structure 


***

**4. Embrace difficulties**

e.g. Mia Blundetto - U.S Marine Corps and the jumping school

Learning:

- encoding : converting sensory perceptions into meaningful representations
- consolidatiom : strenghtening these mental representations for long-term memory
- retrieval : associate the material with a diverse set of cues to recall them (updating retrival cues - easier is not better)

How effort helps:

- reconsolidating memory : the more effort that is required to recall a memory the more the act of recalling benefits the learning
- creating mental models : complex set of interrelated ideas 
- broadening mastery : retrieving practice that you perfom at different times - contexts = building interconnected networks
- fostering conceptual learning : spaced  and interleaved exposure (new concepts e.g. animals)
- improving versatility : practice like you play - play like you practice


Priming the mind for learning:


Generative learning: trying to answer before having it   
Reflection learning: taking a minute to review what has been learned from an experience


Undesirable difficulties vs desirable difficulties

Make mistakes, make mistakes!

**5. Avoid illusion of knowing**

monitoring your own thinking

system 1 (automatic system) : unconscious, intuitive and immediate

system 2 (the controlled system) : slower process of conscious analysis and reasoning

illusion of comprehension \| competence \| remembering

<br/>
memory can be distorted in many ways

- imagination inflation : imagine an event -> begin to believe it
- suggestion : way of a question is asked (e.g witnesses)
- interferences : from other events
- curse of knowledge : tendency to underestimate the time to teach someone (hindsight bias \| knew-it-all-long effect)
- feeling of knowing
- fluency illusion: mistake fluency with a text
- social influence : the social contagion of memory
- *false consensus effect*: fail to recognize the idiosyncratic nature of our personal understanding of the world (e.g gun control)
- flashbulb memories: vivid images of what we retain (e.g 9/11 what you were doing)


mental models:

- the better you know something, the more difficult it becomes to teach it (Harvard)

unskilled and unaware of it:

- incompetent people lack the skills to improve because they are unable to distinguish between incompetence and competence
- Drunning-Kruger effect : incompetent people tend to overestimate their own competence and fail to mismatch what they need to improve (probs caused by negative feedback from others or innacurate =/= success : must go right)
- replace subjective experience with a set of objective gauges outside ourselves to square the judgement with the real world

tools and habits for calibrating your judgment:

- frequent use of testing and retrieval practice
- *do not drop material* from your testing regime once you have gotten it correct 
- *practice and practice again*
- *Peer Instruction* : learning model = reading beforehand + feedback
- *mistakes* are the most efficient way for calibrating your sense of what you know and don't.

**6. Get beyond learning styles**

- all learners are different

active learning from the get-go:

- VARK : differentiate people according their learning experience (visual, auditory, etc.)

successful intelligence:

- *Fluid* intelligence : ability to reason, see relationships, think abstractly
- *crystallized* intelligence: accumulate knowledge and mental models
 
 Sternberg:

 - *Analytical* int
 - *Creative* int
 - *Practical* int 

**Dynamic testing**

1 - a test of some kind to show me where I come up short in knowledge <br/>
2 - dedicate myself to become more competent : reflection/practice/spacing/others

3 - test myself again paying attention to what works better and where I need more work

<u>Structure Building</u>:

Lego blocks: box full of Lego pieces to a city
High structure-builders develop the skill to identify fundational concepts
Low struce-builders struggle in figuring out and sticking with an overarching structure

<u>Rule versus example learning</u>:

example: memorize examples rather than the underlying principle
rule: abstract the underlying principles

<u>Takeaway</u>:

*be the one in charge* : suit up, get out the door and find what you are after
*embrace the notion of successful intelligence* :  describe what you want to do - list the competencies required - what you need to learn and where to find it - go get it
*build the structure*: what are the rules and recall related points : TEST YOURSELF

abstract the underlying rules and piecing them into a structure: you go fore more than knowledge. You go for knowhow : MASTERY.

**7. Increase your abilities**

mnemonics: pocket facts

synapse: connection between neurons (nerve cells) -> signals

neurons[branches] = axons -> dendrites = synapses

neural cell = gray matter vs the wiring = white matter

habit action -> located in the basal ganglia (brain)

neurogenesis : generation of new neurons from the hippocampus

<u>Is IQ mutable ?</u> social status context related (probs higher IQ)

<u>Brain training ?</u>

fluid intellingence : make up IQ vs crystallized int (storage)
the brain is not a muscle : one skill at a time -> does not extend to the rest
*benefits: better habits -> focus attention + practice*

cognitive multipliers :

- embracing growth mindset
- practicing like an expert
- constructing memory cues (signal)


<u>Growth mindset</u>

= intelligence is withing your own control vs *Fixed Mindset* = from birth
discipline + grit + growth mindset = abilities are in your own control

<u>Deliberate Practice</u>

= doing sth repeatedly -> goal directed + repeatedly striving to reach beyond your current level

effort + persistence = remod the brain to a higher level

Most people who achieve expertise in a field are destined to remain average in the other realms of life

<u>Memory cues</u>

mnemonics 
mental palace -> link a topic to a place
peg method -> link a number to a topic (0-9 : sounds like 615 : Shuttle)

**Make it stick**

<u>learning tips for students :</u>

most successful students = take charge of their own learning and follow a disciplined strategy (simple)

*Effortful learning changes your brain*

**Practice retrieving new learning from memory**

= self-quizzing

1. read article/lecture
2. stop at some point and ask yourself : what are the main ideas? How would I define them? What terms or ideas are new to me? How do the ideas relate to what I already know?

-> generating questions is a good way to study

3. take a time in a week to quizz yourself and check the answers 
4. identify weaknesse

-> the harder it is to recall memories, the better it is for the brain

**Spaced out your retrieval practice**

1. schedule of self-quizzing (allows time in between)
2. feeling more sure = add several days/weeks/months
3. do : interleaving the study of 2 or more different topics

**Interleave the study of different problem types**

- Elaboration: process of finding additional layers of meaning in new material (how it relates to your life outside of class)

- Generation: attempt to answer a question or solve a problem before being shown the solution

- Reflection: taking a few minutes to review what has been learned in a recent class

1. what went well?
2. what could have gone better?

- Calibration: act of using an objective instrument to clear away illusions and adjust your judgment to better reflect reality

1. Make the effort to write an answer instead of only read it in your mind

- Mnemonic devices: handy ways to store information and find it again when needed
