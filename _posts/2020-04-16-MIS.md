**Misunderstood**

- better to draw the new knowledge into old one and build mindmap according to it

- rereading is not the key, repeating is

***

**Mix up practice**

- massed practice : repetitive practice on one thing at a time
- spaced practice : review material over a long period of time
- interleaved practice : mixing multiple subjects at a time
- varied practice :  frequent changes of task = confront new situations e.g beanbag
- discrimation skills :  understanding of the interrelationships of the basic elements within a larger structure 


***

**Embrace difficulties**

e.g. Mia Blundetto - U.S Marine Corps and the jumping school

Learning:

- encoding : converting sensory perceptions into meaningful representations
- consolidatiom : strenghtening these mental representations for long-term memory
- retrieval : associate the material with a diverse set of cues to recall them (updating retrival cues - easier is not better)

How effort helps:

- reconsolidating memory : the more effort that is required to recall a memory the more the act of recalling benefits the learning
- creating mental models : complex set of interrelated ideas 
- broadening mastery : retrieving practice that you perfom at different times - contexts = building interconnected networks
- fostering conceptual learning : spaced  and interleaved exposure (new concepts e.g. animals)
- improving versatility : practice like you play - play like you practice


Priming the mind for learning:


Generative learning: trying to answer before having it   
Reflection learning: taking a minute to review what has been learned from an experience


Undesirable difficulties vs desirable difficulties

Make mistakes, make mistakes!

**Avoid illusion of knowing**
