<p><strong>2. Misunderstood</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>better to draw the new knowledge into old one and build mindmap according to it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rereading is not the key, repeating is</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>3. Mix up practice</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>massed practice : repetitive practice on one thing at a time</li>
  <li>spaced practice : review material over a long period of time</li>
  <li>interleaved practice : mixing multiple subjects at a time</li>
  <li>varied practice :  frequent changes of task = confront new situations e.g beanbag</li>
  <li>discrimation skills :  understanding of the interrelationships of the basic elements within a larger structure</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>4. Embrace difficulties</strong></p>

<p>e.g. Mia Blundetto - U.S Marine Corps and the jumping school</p>

<p>Learning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>encoding : converting sensory perceptions into meaningful representations</li>
  <li>consolidatiom : strenghtening these mental representations for long-term memory</li>
  <li>retrieval : associate the material with a diverse set of cues to recall them (updating retrival cues - easier is not better)</li>
</ul>

<p>How effort helps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reconsolidating memory : the more effort that is required to recall a memory the more the act of recalling benefits the learning</li>
  <li>creating mental models : complex set of interrelated ideas</li>
  <li>broadening mastery : retrieving practice that you perfom at different times - contexts = building interconnected networks</li>
  <li>fostering conceptual learning : spaced  and interleaved exposure (new concepts e.g. animals)</li>
  <li>improving versatility : practice like you play - play like you practice</li>
</ul>

<p>Priming the mind for learning:</p>

<p>Generative learning: trying to answer before having it <br />
Reflection learning: taking a minute to review what has been learned from an experience</p>

<p>Undesirable difficulties vs desirable difficulties</p>

<p>Make mistakes, make mistakes!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>5. Avoid illusion of knowing</strong></p>

<p>monitoring your own thinking</p>

<p>system 1 (automatic system) : unconscious, intuitive and immediate</p>

<p>system 2 (the controlled system) : slower process of conscious analysis and reasoning</p>

<p>illusion of comprehension | competence | remembering</p>

<p><br />
memory can be distorted in many ways</p>

<ul>
  <li>imagination inflation : imagine an event -&gt; begin to believe it</li>
  <li>suggestion : way of a question is asked (e.g witnesses)</li>
  <li>interferences : from other events</li>
  <li>curse of knowledge : tendency to underestimate the time to teach someone (hindsight bias | knew-it-all-long effect)</li>
  <li>feeling of knowing</li>
  <li>fluency illusion: mistake fluency with a text</li>
  <li>social influence : the social contagion of memory</li>
  <li><em>false consensus effect</em>: fail to recognize the idiosyncratic nature of our personal understanding of the world (e.g gun control)</li>
  <li>flashbulb memories: vivid images of what we retain (e.g 9/11 what you were doing)</li>
</ul>

<p>mental models:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the better you know something, the more difficult it becomes to teach it (Harvard)</li>
</ul>

<p>unskilled and unaware of it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>incompetent people lack the skills to improve because they are unable to distinguish between incompetence and competence</li>
  <li>Drunning-Kruger effect : incompetent people tend to overestimate their own competence and fail to mismatch what they need to improve (probs caused by negative feedback from others or innacurate =/= success : must go right)</li>
  <li>replace subjective experience with a set of objective gauges outside ourselves to square the judgement with the real world</li>
</ul>

<p>tools and habits for calibrating your judgment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>frequent use of testing and retrieval practice</li>
  <li><em>do not drop material</em> from your testing regime once you have gotten it correct</li>
  <li><em>practice and practice again</em></li>
  <li><em>Peer Instruction</em> : learning model = reading beforehand + feedback</li>
  <li><em>mistakes</em> are the most efficient way for calibrating your sense of what you know and donâ€™t.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>6. Get beyond learning styles</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>all learners are different</li>
</ul>

<p>active learning from the get-go:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VARK : differentiate people according their learning experience (visual, auditory, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>successful intelligence:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Fluid</em> intelligence : ability to reason, see relationships, think abstractly</li>
  <li><em>crystallized</em> intelligence: accumulate knowledge and mental models</li>
</ul>

<p>Sternberg:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Analytical</em> int</li>
  <li><em>Creative</em> int</li>
  <li><em>Practical</em> int</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dynamic testing</strong></p>

<p>1 - a test of some kind to show me where I come up short in knowledge <br />
2 - dedicate myself to become more competent : reflection/practice/spacing/others</p>

<p>3 - test myself again paying attention to what works better and where I need more work</p>

<p><u>Structure Building</u>:</p>

<p>Lego blocks: box full of Lego pieces to a city
High structure-builders develop the skill to identify fundational concepts
Low struce-builders struggle in figuring out and sticking with an overarching structure</p>

<p><u>Rule versus example learning</u>:</p>

<p>example: memorize examples rather than the underlying principle
rule: abstract the underlying principles</p>

<p><u>Takeaway</u>:</p>

<p><em>be the one in charge</em> : suit up, get out the door and find what you are after
<em>embrace the notion of successful intelligence</em> :  describe what you want to do - list the competencies required - what you need to learn and where to find it - go get it
<em>build the structure</em>: what are the rules and recall related points : TEST YOURSELF</p>

<p>abstract the underlying rules and piecing them into a structure: you go fore more than knowledge. You go for knowhow : MASTERY.</p>

<p><strong>7. Increase your abilities</strong></p>

<p>mnemonics: pocket facts</p>

<p>synapse: connection between neurons (nerve cells) -&gt; signals</p>

<p>neurons[branches] = axons -&gt; dendrites = synapses</p>

<p>neural cell = gray matter vs the wiring = white matter</p>

<p>habit action -&gt; located in the basal ganglia (brain)</p>

<p>neurogenesis : generation of new neurons from the hippocampus</p>

<p><u>Is IQ mutable ?</u> social status context related (probs higher IQ)</p>

<p><u>Brain training ?</u></p>

<p>fluid intellingence : make up IQ vs crystallized int (storage)
the brain is not a muscle : one skill at a time -&gt; does not extend to the rest
<em>benefits: better habits -&gt; focus attention + practice</em></p>

<p>cognitive multipliers :</p>

<ul>
  <li>embracing growth mindset</li>
  <li>practicing like an expert</li>
  <li>constructing memory cues (signal)</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Growth mindset</u></p>

<p>= intelligence is withing your own control vs <em>Fixed Mindset</em> = from birth
discipline + grit + growth mindset = abilities are in your own control</p>

<p><u>Deliberate Practice</u></p>

<p>= doing sth repeatedly -&gt; goal directed + repeatedly striving to reach beyond your current level</p>

<p>effort + persistence = remod the brain to a higher level</p>

<p>Most people who achieve expertise in a field are destined to remain average in the other realms of life</p>

<p><u>Memory cues</u></p>

<p>mnemonics 
mental palace -&gt; link a topic to a place
peg method -&gt; link a number to a topic (0-9 : sounds like 615 : Shuttle)</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Make it stick</strong></p>

<p><u>learning tips for students :</u></p>

<p>most successful students = take charge of their own learning and follow a disciplined strategy (simple)</p>

<p><em>Effortful learning changes your brain</em></p>

<p><strong>Practice retrieving new learning from memory</strong></p>

<p>= self-quizzing</p>

<ol>
  <li>read article/lecture</li>
  <li>stop at some point and ask yourself : what are the main ideas? How would I define them? What terms or ideas are new to me? How do the ideas relate to what I already know?</li>
</ol>

<p>-&gt; generating questions is a good way to study</p>

<ol>
  <li>take a time in a week to quizz yourself and check the answers</li>
  <li>identify weaknesse</li>
</ol>

<p>-&gt; the harder it is to recall memories, the better it is for the brain</p>

<p><strong>Spaced out your retrieval practice</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>schedule of self-quizzing (allows time in between)</li>
  <li>feeling more sure = add several days/weeks/months</li>
  <li>do : interleaving the study of 2 or more different topics</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Interleave the study of different problem types</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Elaboration: process of finding additional layers of meaning in new material (how it relates to your life outside of class)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generation: attempt to answer a question or solve a problem before being shown the solution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reflection: taking a few minutes to review what has been learned in a recent class</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>what went well?</li>
  <li>what could have gone better?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Calibration: act of using an objective instrument to clear away illusions and adjust your judgment to better reflect reality</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Make the effort to write an answer instead of only read it in your mind</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Mnemonic devices: handy ways to store information and find it again when needed</li>
</ul>
