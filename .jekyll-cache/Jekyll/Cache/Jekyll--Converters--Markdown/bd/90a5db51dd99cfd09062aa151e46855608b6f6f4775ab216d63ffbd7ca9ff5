<p><strong>Misunderstood</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>better to draw the new knowledge into old one and build mindmap according to it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rereading is not the key, repeating is</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Mix up practice</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>massed practice : repetitive practice on one thing at a time</li>
  <li>spaced practice : review material over a long period of time</li>
  <li>interleaved practice : mixing multiple subjects at a time</li>
  <li>varied practice :  frequent changes of task = confront new situations e.g beanbag</li>
  <li>discrimation skills :  understanding of the interrelationships of the basic elements within a larger structure</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Embrace difficulties</strong></p>

<p>e.g. Mia Blundetto - U.S Marine Corps and the jumping school</p>

<p>Learning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>encoding : converting sensory perceptions into meaningful representations</li>
  <li>consolidatiom : strenghtening these mental representations for long-term memory</li>
  <li>retrieval : associate the material with a diverse set of cues to recall them (updating retrival cues - easier is not better)</li>
</ul>

<p>How effort helps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reconsolidating memory : the more effort that is required to recall a memory the more the act of recalling benefits the learning</li>
  <li>creating mental models : complex set of interrelated ideas</li>
  <li>broadening mastery : retrieving practice that you perfom at different times - contexts = building interconnected networks</li>
  <li>fostering conceptual learning : spaced  and interleaved exposure (new concepts e.g. animals)</li>
  <li>improving versatility : practice like you play - play like you practice</li>
</ul>

<p>Priming the mind for learning:</p>

<p>Generative learning: trying to answer before having it</p>

<p>Reflection learning: taking a minute to review what has been learned from an experience</p>

<p>Undesirable difficulties vs desirable difficulties</p>

<p>Make mistakes, make mistakes!</p>

<p><strong>Avoid illusion of knowing</strong></p>
