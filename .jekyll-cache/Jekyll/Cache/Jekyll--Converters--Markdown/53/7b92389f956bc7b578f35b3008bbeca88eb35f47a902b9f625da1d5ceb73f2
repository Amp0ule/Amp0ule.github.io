<p><strong>Misunderstood</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>better to draw the new knowledge into old one and build mindmap according to it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rereading is not the key, repeating is</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Mix up practice</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>massed practice : repetitive practice on one thing at a time</li>
  <li>spaced practice : review material over a long period of time</li>
  <li>interleaved practice : mixing multiple subjects at a time</li>
  <li>varied practice :  frequent changes of task = confront new situations e.g beanbag</li>
  <li>discrimation skills :  understanding of the interrelationships of the basic elements within a larger structure</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Embrace difficulties</strong></p>

<p>e.g. Mia Blundetto - U.S Marine Corps and the jumping school</p>

<p>Learning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>encoding : converting sensory perceptions into meaningful representations</li>
  <li>consolidatiom : strenghtening these mental representations for long-term memory</li>
  <li>retrieval : associate the material with a diverse set of cues to recall them (updating retrival cues - easier is not better)</li>
</ul>

<p>How effort helps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reconsolidating memory : the more effort that is required to recall a memory the more the act of recalling benefits the learning</li>
  <li>creating mental models : complex set of interrelated ideas</li>
  <li>broadening mastery : retrieving practice that you perfom at different times - contexts = building interconnected networks</li>
  <li>fostering conceptual learning : spaced  and interleaved exposure (new concepts e.g. animals)</li>
  <li>improving versatility : practice like you play - play like you practice</li>
</ul>

<p>Priming the mind for learning:</p>

<p>Generative learning: trying to answer before having it <br />
Reflection learning: taking a minute to review what has been learned from an experience</p>

<p>Undesirable difficulties vs desirable difficulties</p>

<p>Make mistakes, make mistakes!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Avoid illusion of knowing</strong></p>

<p>monitoring your own thinking</p>

<p>system 1 (automatic system) : unconscious, intuitive and immediate</p>

<p>system 2 (the controlled system) : slower process of conscious analysis and reasoning</p>

<p>illusion of comprehension | competence | remembering</p>

<p><br />
memory can be distorted in many ways</p>

<ul>
  <li>imagination inflation : imagine an event -&gt; begin to believe it</li>
  <li>suggestion : way of a question is asked (e.g witnesses)</li>
  <li>interferences : from other events</li>
  <li>curse of knowledge : tendency to underestimate the time to teach someone (hindsight bias | knew-it-all-long effect)</li>
  <li>feeling of knowing</li>
  <li>fluency illusion: mistake fluency with a text</li>
  <li>social influence : the social contagion of memory</li>
  <li><em>false consensus effect</em>: fail to recognize the idiosyncratic nature of our personal understanding of the world (e.g gun control)</li>
  <li>flashbulb memories: vivid images of what we retain (e.g 9/11 what you were doing)</li>
</ul>

<p>mental models:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the better you know something, the more difficult it becomes to teach it (Harvard)</li>
</ul>

<p>unskilled and unaware of it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>incompetent people lack the skills to improve because they are unable to distinguish between incompetence and competence</li>
  <li>Drunning-Kruger effect : incompetent people tend to overestimate their own competence and fail to mismatch what they need to improve (probs caused by negative feedback from others or innacurate =/= success : must go right)</li>
  <li>replace subjective experience with a set of objective gauges outside ourselves to square the judgement with the real world</li>
</ul>

<p>tools and habits for calibrating your judgment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>frequent use of testing and retrieval practice</li>
  <li><em>do not drop material</em> from your testing regime once you have gotten it correct</li>
  <li><em>practice and practice again</em></li>
  <li><em>Peer Instruction</em> : learning model = reading beforehand + feedback</li>
  <li><em>mistakes</em> are the most efficient way for calibrating your sense of what you know and donâ€™t.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Get beyond learning styles</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>all learners are different</li>
</ul>

<p>active learning from the get-go:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VARK : differentiate people according their learning experience (visual, auditory, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>successful intelligence:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Fluid</em> intelligence : ability to reason, see relationships, think abstractly</li>
  <li><em>crystallized</em> intelligence: accumulate knowledge and mental models</li>
</ul>

<p>Sternberg:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Analytical</em> int</li>
  <li><em>Creative</em> int</li>
  <li><em>Practical</em> int</li>
</ul>

<p>Dynamic testing:</p>

<p>1 - a test of some kind to show me where I come up short in knowledge
2 - dedicate myself to become more competent : reflection/practice/spacing/others
3 - test myself again paying attention to what works better and where I need more work</p>
