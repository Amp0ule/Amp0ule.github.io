<p><strong>Chapter 1 - A breakthrough in the Treatment of Mood Disorders</strong></p>

<p>Depression is the number one public health problem in the world.</p>

<p>Cognitive Therapy (CT) is a mood modification that you can learn on your own :
    1. Rapid Symptomatic Improvement 
    2. Understanding : clear explanation of your actual mood.
    3. Self-control 
    4. Prevention and Personnal Growth : reassessment.</p>

<p>You create those feelings by the dialogue you are having with yourself.</p>

  <li>
    <p>ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING : Black and White</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OVERGENERALIZATION : single negative event = never-ending pattern of defeat</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MENTAL FILTER : one negative event is making everything dark (drop on ink)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE : they-dont-count experiences</p>

<p>you are the one who‚Äôs creating every last oune of the outrage you experience = cognitive distorsions</p>

<em>magnification</em> : exagerate the importance of a negative event
innapropriate <em>should and should‚Äônt</em> statements</p>

Learn to expect craziness : discard unrealistic expectation
Enlightened manipulation : learn on the positives things from people -&gt; changing mood aka the uperbeat reward system (focusing on what people want)
Should reaction : <em>DCT</em></p>

</ol>

<p>Accurate empathy =/= sympathy (capacity to feel the same way someone else feels) -&gt; ability to comprehend with accuracy the precise thoughts and motivations of other people
